# Getting Started

### What is Rotur?

Rotur is a cloudlink based, networking packet standard and accounts system packaged into an easy to use extension. Made to make turbowarp operating systems more interconnected and easier to develop.

### When is Rotur? :3

Rotur is a project started on the 29th of June, 2024.

***

### Who is Rotur for?

Rotur is aimed at Turbowarp-based operating systems but can be used in other environments as long as websockets are available.

The standard should allow for things like cross-play of games between operating systems, or collaborative editing on text editors, running on completely different projects!

We think this could be really really cool if its implemented thoroughly at a wide scale, and it is currently Present in 5 Systems (2 Released)

***

### Why use Rotur?

Rotur enables a whole range of new possibilities, simulated ports, client info, timestamps and more.
